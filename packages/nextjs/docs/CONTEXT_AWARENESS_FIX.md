# ENS AI Context Awareness Fix

## Problem
The ENS AI service was not context-aware and couldn't handle follow-up questions because:

1. **New Agent Instance Per Request**: The API route created a new `ENSAgent` instance for each request, losing all conversation context
2. **No Session Management**: No mechanism to maintain conversation state across multiple API calls
3. **Lost Context**: Follow-up questions like "How much does it cost?" after asking "Is myname.eth available?" would fail because the AI didn't remember what "it" referred to

## Solution

### 1. Session-Based Context Management
- **Global Session Storage**: Created `globalAgents` and `globalAIServices` Maps to maintain instances per user session
- **Session Keys**: Use user address or 'anonymous' as session keys
- **Persistent Context**: AI service instances persist across requests, maintaining conversation history and context

### 2. Enhanced API Route (`/api/ens/chat/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Before: New instance each time
const agent = new ENSAgent();
await agent.initialize(provider);

// After: Persistent session-based instances
const { agent, aiService } = getOrCreateUserSession(userAddress);
const response = await aiService.processMessage(message, userAddress);
```

### 3. Conversation History Restoration
- **History Sync**: API accepts `conversationHistory` from client for session recovery
- **Smart Restoration**: Only restores history if client has more messages than server
- **Proper Format**: Converts client message format to internal `ChatMessage` format

### 4. Enhanced AI Service Methods
Added new methods for better session management:
- `getConversationHistory()`: Get current chat history
- `setConversationHistory()`: Restore chat history
- `clearConversationHistory()`: Reset session
- `getCurrentContext()`: Get current context state
- `updateContext()`: Update context values

### 5. Context Response
API now returns conversation context to client:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Response...",
  "conversationContext": {
    "lastENSName": "mytest.eth",
    "lastOperation": "availability",
    "historyLength": 4
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Example Conversation Flow:
1. **User**: "Is mytest.eth available?"
   - AI Service: Stores `lastENSName = "mytest.eth"`, `lastOperation = "availability"`
   - Response: "mytest.eth is available for registration!"

2. **User**: "How much does it cost?"
   - AI Service: Recognizes follow-up pattern, uses `lastENSName` from context
   - Response: "The cost to register mytest.eth for 1 year is 0.01 ETH."

3. **User**: "What can I do with it?"
   - AI Service: Replaces "it" with "mytest.eth" from context
   - Response: "Here's what you can do with mytest.eth: 1. Register it, 2. Check cost..."

### Context Patterns Handled:
- **Pronouns**: "it", "that", "this", "the name", "the domain"
- **Confirmations**: "yes", "sure", "ok", "do it"
- **Follow-up Questions**: "how much", "what can I do", "tell me more"
- **Operation References**: "renew it", "transfer it", "set records"

## Benefits

1. **Natural Conversation**: Users can have natural multi-turn conversations
2. **Better UX**: No need to repeat ENS names in every message
3. **Intelligent Follow-ups**: AI understands context and responds appropriately
4. **Session Persistence**: Context maintained across page refreshes (with history sync)
5. **Scalable**: Session-based approach can be extended to use Redis/database in production

## Testing

Run the test script to verify context awareness:
```bash
cd flow-scaffold/packages/nextjs
node scripts/test-context-awareness.js
```

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. **Replace In-Memory Storage**: Use Redis or database for session storage
2. **Session Cleanup**: Implement TTL for session data
3. **User Authentication**: Tie sessions to authenticated users
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting per session
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle session corruption gracefully

## Files Modified

1. `services/ensagent/ai/index.ts` - Enhanced AI service with context tracking
2. `app/api/ens/chat/route.ts` - Session-based API route
3. `scripts/test-context-awareness.js` - Test script
4. `docs/CONTEXT_AWARENESS_FIX.md` - This documentation

The AI is now truly context-aware and can handle natural follow-up questions like a human assistant would!
